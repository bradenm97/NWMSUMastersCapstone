# NWMSUMastersCapstone
Repo for all of the documents for my Masters Degree Capstone Project

Master of Science in Data Analytics at Northwest Missouri State University


For this Capstone project I was asked to create a data science project.

At a high level I used data collected by the US Department of Energy on cars and fuel economy.
Initially  I was going to use Excel for this project, however after cleaning and exploring the data I decided to move everything to Python.

I built three models to predict the MPG of cars when given some inputs that pertain to the power and drive train.

Using Scikit-learn I created a Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and a Random Forest Model.

The clean data was split 80/20 into a training and test data split.

When using the test data set the Random Forest Model performed the best
