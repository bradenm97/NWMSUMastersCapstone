# NWMSUMastersCapstone
Repo for all of the documents for my Masters Degree Capstone Project

Master of Science in Data Analytics at Northwest Missouri State University


For this Capstone project I was asked to create a data science project.

This Readme will be a short blurb explaining what/why I did for this project.

At a high level I used data collected by the US Department of Energy on cars and fuel economy.
I set out to build three models to predict the MPG of cars when given some inputs that pertain to the power and drive train.


Initially  I was going to use Excel for this project, however after cleaning and exploring the data I decided to move everything to Python.

Within python I created a Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and a Random Forest Model.
This was built using tools within Scikit-learn.

The clean data was split 80/20 into a training and test data split.

When using the test data set the Random Forest Model performed the best
